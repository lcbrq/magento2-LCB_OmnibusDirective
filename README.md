## OmnibusDirective addon for Magento 2

### Version `1.0.0`

Made in hurry as we were not able to find extension that respects both special and catalog price rules

At the moment only method to update historical prices is running the command in CLI

```bin/magento lcb:omnibus:parse:catalog```

I will add a cronjob in next release. Feel free to fork and PR.
